## Atmosphere
Green/Brown parts need to be sintered in an oxygen free atmosphere. 

This can be achieved in a number of ways:
* Reducing atmosphere (e.g. hydrogen or hydrogen/nitrogen mix)
* inert atmosphere
* Vacuum
* Sintering Carbon &/ Carbon (Graphite) crucible

### Reducing atmosphere

PolyMIM 316L standard process involves sintering in 100% Hydrogen
FabMX apparently has some success in  10%H 90%N

(d) Hydrogen reducing atmospheres can be explosive.
(d) Oven requires gas connection
(d) Gas storage required
(d) may require ventilation

### inert atmosphere

Examples include Pure nitrogen or argon
(d) Oven requires gas connection
(d) Gas storage required
(d) may require ventilation

### Vacuum

(a) does not require gas storage

(d) requires a suitable kiln
(d) may require ventilation


### Sintering Carbon

Sintering carbon reacts with the oxygen in preference to the metal part, preventing oxidation.

(d) This is added after the debinding step before the sintering step so adds inefficiencies in time (cool down to room temperature, add carbon, ramp back up to sintering temperature)

(a) Works without the requirement for an oven with a gas/vacuum connection

## Process
(from virtual foundry as an example for now):
https://thevirtualfoundry.com/help/#debindingandsinteringfilamet

Pack:
S1: Place Steel Blend refractory in crucible
S2: Bury the print in the Steel Blend
S3: Tamp down, don’t pack or smoosh
S4: Leave about 40mm of room on top
S5: Part should be surrounded by refractory
S6: Keep at least 15mm between the part and the crucible walls and top of refractory
S7: Put the crucible in the kiln
Debind:
S8: Ramp furnace to 204°C (400°F) over the course of 2 hours.
S9: Hold at 204°C (400°F) for 2 hours*
S10: Over the course of 2 hours, ramp to 427°C (800°F)
S11: Hold at 427°C (800°F) for 2 hours*
S12: Let furnace cool to room temperature
Sinter:
S13: Fill the space at the top of the crucible with Sintering Carbon
S14: Ramp furnace to 593°C (1100°F) as fast as it will go
S15: Hold at 593°C (1100°F) for 2 hours*
S16: Over the course of 2 hours, ramp to Sinter Temp (chart below)
S17: Hold at Sinter Temp for 4 hours*
Cool Down:
S18: Over the course of 6 hours, ramp down to 593°C (1100°F) – do not hold
S19: Program ends. Let furnace cool to room temp from 593°C (1100°F)
*Hold times listed are ideal for a part that is less than a 50mm cube. Hold longer for larger or very thick parts and/or larger crucibles.
Experiment with hold times if the parts are not sintered correctly.
Expected shrinkage with these instructions is 10%.
